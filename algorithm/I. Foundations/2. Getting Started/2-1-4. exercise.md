Consider the problem of adding two nnn-bit binary integers, stored in two n-element arrays A and B. 
The sum of the two integers should be stored in binary form in an (n+1)-element array C. 
State the problem formally and write pseudocode for adding the two integers

PseudoCode:


ADD-BINARY(A, B):

    C = new integer[A.length + 1]
    carry = 0
    
    for i = 1 to A.length
        C[i] = (A[i] + B[i] + carry) % 2  // remainder
        carry = (A[i] + B[i] + carry) / 2 // quotient
    C[i] = carry
    
    return C
