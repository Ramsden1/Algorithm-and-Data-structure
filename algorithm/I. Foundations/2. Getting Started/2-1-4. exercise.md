Consider the problem of adding two nnn-bit binary integers, stored in two n-element arrays A and B. 
The sum of the two integers should be stored in binary form in an (n+1)-element array C. 
State the problem formally and write pseudocode for adding the two integers

###[Implementation](https://github.com/Ramsden1/Algorithm-and-Data-structure/blob/main/algorithm/code/2-1-4_exercise.py)

PseudoCode:


	def ADD-BINARY(A, B):

		C = new integer[A.length + 1]
		carry = 0
	    for i = 1 to A.length
			C[i] = (A[i] + B[i] + carry) % 2  // remainder
			carry = (A[i] + B[i] + carry) / 2 // quotient
	    C[i] = carry
	    return C
